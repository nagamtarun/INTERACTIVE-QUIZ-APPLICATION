This interactive quiz application is a simple web-based tool built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to test users' knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions, with real-time interaction and scoring. The application loads questions dynamically from a predefined JavaScript array, each containing a question, a list of options, and the index of the correct answer. When a user selects an answer, the application immediately checks whether it is correct, updates the score accordingly, and moves on to the next question. After the final question, the user is presented with their total score and an option to restart the quiz.

The HTML structure defines the layout, including containers for the quiz interface, question text, answer options, and result display. CSS is used to style the interface, giving it a clean, modern appearance with centered content, styled buttons, and responsive design elements for better usability. JavaScript handles the core logicâ€”loading questions, checking answers, updating the UI dynamically, and managing user interaction without requiring a page reload.

This type of application is ideal for learning platforms, educational games, and training programs where real-time feedback is essential. It can be extended easily with features like timers, progress bars, score history (using `localStorage`), or even integration with backend databases for more robust functionality.
